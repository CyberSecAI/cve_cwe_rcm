# CWE View for Benchmarking

## CWE Views

See https://riskbasedprioritization.github.io/cwe/cwe_views/.


## Benchmark View Selection

The most specific accurate CWE should be assigned to a CVE i.e. not limited by views e.g. [View-1003](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1003.html).

- Therefore, the **benchmark should support [all CWEs](../dataset.md#REQ_COVERAGE_ALL_CWES)**


> [!TIP]
> Research View ([View-1000](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1000.html)) will be used as the CWE View to base benchmark scoring on.
